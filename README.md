This repository contains code intending to understand animal population dynamics based on the poses. Poses are assumed to be unique signatures for these animals and to do a census, the challenge is to avoid counting one animal twice hence the need to be able to re-identify the particular animal<br>
A Siamese Network with an LSTM head is proposed to solve this problem with a contrastive or triplet loss.<br>
