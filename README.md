This repository contains code with the aim to understand animal population dynamics based on the poses. Poses are assumed to be unique signatures for these animals and to do a census a challenge is to avoid counting one animal twice hence the need to be able to re-identify the particular animal<br>
A Siamese Network with LSTM head is proposed to solve this problem with a contrastive loss or a triplet loss.
